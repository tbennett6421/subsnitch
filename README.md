# subsnitch
subsnitch is a program I made for stitching coverart,audio,subtitles into a video format. Feel free to use this to add subtitles to any audio work or for translation purposes.

# Installation
I highly recommend you use `pipx` to install this, as it creates the virtualenv for you and seamlessly handles the loading of the virtual environment when running this tool. If you choose not to use `pipx`, you should create a virtualenv and possibly a wrapper script to launch this in the virtualenv.

```sh
pipx install tsiconv
```

# Usage

The following is the help for the program

# Examples
